# Changelog

Notable changes to Football Predictor. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
History before this file was introduced lives in `git log`.

## 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Club friendlies** (`scripts/fetch_club_friendlies.py`): pre-season /
  exhibition club games (e.g. Olympiakos–Lyon) now appear in the app under
  the new league code `ClubFriendly`. Source: API-Football "Friendlies
  Clubs" (league 667) — none of the existing fixture sources
  (football-data.org free tier, The Odds API) carries club friendlies.
  Team names are resolved against training-data names (static map → slug →
  alias → difflib, ambiguity-safe); fixtures with unknown teams are skipped
  by default (`--allow-unknown` keeps 1-known-side games). The same run
  fills final scores for played friendlies and prunes cancelled ones.
- `confidence_for()` in `backend/app/ml/predict.py`: league-aware confidence
  wrapper. `ClubFriendly` (`LOW_CONFIDENCE_LEAGUES`) is **always served as
  `low` confidence** — friendlies are heavy-rotation exhibition games the
  training distribution doesn't cover. Wired through every path that
  computes the label: `compute_predictions.py`,
  `fetch_european_fixtures.py`, `predict_match()`, and both serve-time
  recompute sites (`routers/matches.py`, `routers/predictions.py`).
- Daily pipeline step **[5b]** in `run_daily.sh`: refresh club friendlies
  (fixtures + results) before the generic prediction step.
- `ClubFriendly` in `VALID_LEAGUES` (API filter) and in the frontend
  `LEAGUES` list ("Club Friendlies" 🤝).

### Notes
- Friendlies have no odds source (The Odds API has no club-friendlies key),
  so their odds/EV columns stay NULL and they can never become value-bet
  suggestions or ledger tickets.

### Added
- **Base-market demotion in the dynamic value gate** (`_market_is_proven` in
  `backend/app/ml/odds_analysis_service.py`). Base markets (Home Win, Draw)
  are no longer exempt from the record: they demote to "watch" early at
  n ≥ 15 settled with ROI ≤ −20% (`DEMOTE_MIN_SAMPLES`, `DEMOTE_ROI_CEIL`),
  and are held to the standard ROI ≥ 0% floor at n ≥ 30. Stateless — a demoted
  market re-enters when its cumulative post-cutoff record recovers.
- `demoted` field + `demote_min_samples` / `demote_roi_ceil_pct` constants in
  the `/admin/market-record` response.
- Red **demoted** status badge and rule copy on `/admin/markets`.
- 8 new gate tests in `backend/tests/test_dynamic_gate.py` (bleeder demotes
  early, small-sample noise survives, full-sample floor applies to base,
  recovery re-entry, non-base promotion unchanged).

### Changed
- `/admin/market-record` now computes proven/demoted status through the same
  shared rule as the live gate (previously duplicated logic that could drift).

### Effect on live data
- **Draw demoted** on the new-model record (0/16 settled post-cutoff, −100%
  ROI — all three misses in the last WC week were draws we suggested against).
  Headline suggestions now come from the remaining proven set; Draw shows as
  watch until its record recovers. Home Win stays (n = 8, still noise) but
  faces the same rule at n ≥ 15.

  (`feat: move to cloudflare`).
